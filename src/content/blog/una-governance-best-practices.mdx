## The Foundation of Effective UNA Governance

Governance is the backbone of any successful organization, and Unincorporated Nonprofit Associations are no exception. While UNAs offer flexibility and simplicity compared to traditional corporations, they still require thoughtful governance structures and practices to ensure long-term success and mission fulfillment.

### What is UNA Governance?

UNA governance encompasses the systems, processes, and practices that guide how your organization makes decisions, manages resources, and fulfills its mission. Effective governance provides:
