# UNA Formation Beyond California: Multi-State Guide for National Organizations

## Building on SELC's California Foundation

The [Sustainable Economies Law Center (SELC)](https://www.theselc.org/how_to_be_an_unincorporated_association) has created an excellent resource for California UNA formation, covering everything from basic formation to tax-exempt status. However, many organizations find themselves needing to expand beyond California's borders to serve their mission effectively.

This guide builds on SELC's comprehensive California framework to help you navigate multi-state UNA operations, compliance requirements, and strategic considerations for national expansion.

## Why Expand Beyond California?

### **Mission-Driven Expansion**
- **Geographic Reach**: Serve communities across state lines
- **Resource Access**: Tap into different funding sources and partnerships
- **Member Distribution**: Accommodate members located in multiple states
- **Program Delivery**: Provide services where they're needed most

### **Strategic Advantages**
- **Diversified Risk**: Spread operational risk across multiple jurisdictions
- **Enhanced Credibility**: National presence increases organizational legitimacy
- **Funding Opportunities**: Access to state-specific grants and funding
- **Partnership Development**: Build relationships with local organizations

## Multi-State Formation Strategies

### **1. Primary State Selection**

**Building on SELC's California Framework:**
If you're already formed in California following SELC's guide, you have several options:

**Option A: California as Primary State**
- Maintain California as your primary formation state
- Register as foreign entity in other states where you operate
- Leverage California's strong UNA legal framework
- File annual reports in each state where you're registered

**Option B: Strategic State Selection**
- Evaluate other states for primary formation
- Consider Texas (no annual reports required)
- Consider Delaware (business-friendly environment)
- Maintain California operations as secondary

### **2. Secondary State Registration**

**When to Register in Additional States:**
- **Physical Presence**: Office, staff, or regular activities
- **Significant Revenue**: $50,000+ in annual revenue from state
- **Property Ownership**: Real estate or significant assets
- **Employee Presence**: Staff or contractors in the state
- **Program Delivery**: Regular services or events

**Registration Requirements by State:**
- **California**: Form UA-100 ($25, expires every 5 years)
- **Texas**: No registration required for basic operations
- **New York**: Varies by county, typically $50-100
- **Florida**: Department of State filing, $35-50
- **Illinois**: Secretary of State filing, $50

## Compliance and Risk Management

### **Multi-State Tax Considerations**

**Federal Tax Status:**
- Single 501(c)(3) application covers all states
- File 990-N or 990 based on revenue thresholds
- Unrelated business income tax (UBIT) considerations

**State Tax Obligations:**
- **Income Tax**: File in states where you have nexus
- **Sales Tax**: Register if selling goods/services

### **Legal Structure Considerations**

**Governance Documents:**
- Update bylaws to address multi-state operations
