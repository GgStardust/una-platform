## Understanding UNA Scaling: The Foundation

Scaling a UNA involves more than simply expanding operations or increasing membership—it requires thoughtful planning and strategic decision-making that preserves your organization's mission and values while building capacity for greater impact. Unlike traditional corporate scaling that often focuses primarily on growth metrics, UNA scaling must balance expansion with the collaborative, mission-driven character that makes UNAs unique and effective.

The key to successful UNA scaling lies in understanding when and how to grow, what structures and processes support effective scaling, and how to maintain your organization's authentic character while building capacity for greater impact. This requires careful consideration of your mission, values, and operational needs, as well as the legal and practical requirements of operating in multiple jurisdictions.

Effective scaling enables your UNA to serve more people, address larger challenges, and create greater impact while maintaining the collaborative, values-driven approach that makes UNAs powerful tools for social change.

## Strategic Growth Planning

## When to Consider Incorporation

### Factors Favoring Incorporation

As UNAs scale and become more complex, there may come a point where incorporation as a formal corporation becomes advantageous or necessary.

**Incorporation considerations:**
- Increased operational complexity requiring corporate structure
- Liability concerns needing stronger protection
- Funding requirements mandating corporate status
- Need for professional staff and management

- Access to corporate funding and investment opportunities
- Professional management and governance structures
- Greater operational flexibility and efficiency

### Factors Favoring Continued UNA Status

Many UNAs continue to operate effectively as unincorporated associations even as they scale, particularly if they value the flexibility and collaborative character that UNAs provide.

**UNA advantages:**
- Strong member engagement and participation
- Effective governance and decision-making processes
- Alignment between UNA structure and organizational values
- Operational flexibility and adaptability
- Lower compliance and administrative costs

**Continued UNA considerations:**
- Activities and needs can be met within UNA framework
- Members value collaborative, consensus-driven approach
