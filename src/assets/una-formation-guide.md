# UNA Formation Guide
### The 7 Steps Every Group Needs to Know

---

## Introduction
Forming an **Unincorporated Association (UNA)** is a decisive act of collective creation. It is a way of creating organizations that reflect their members and their shared vision. A UNA offers a parallel path: it is legally recognized, yet flexible enough to let your group define how it values people, resources, and purpose.

At its heart, UNA formation is about sovereignty in community. It allows groups to come together, organize around shared goals, and make choices that align with their values, whether that includes pursuing profit to reinvest in the mission, cultivating cultural expression, or sustaining collective wellbeing.

This guide walks you through the essential steps of UNA formation. It is both a practical roadmap and an invitation to imagine what becomes possible when we organize in ways that mirror who we truly are.

## The 7 Steps

### 1. Gather Members
A UNA requires at least two people. Choose members who are committed, trustworthy, and aligned with your group's values.  

> **Tip:** Write down names, roles, and contact info for at least 2–3 people.

---

### 2. Define Your Purpose
Your purpose is the anchor for everything your UNA does. Keep it clear, simple, and actionable.  

> **Tip:** Start with: *"Our UNA exists to…"* and keep it to 1–2 sentences.

---

### 3. Write a UNA Agreement
This is your governing document. It should include:  
- Members and roles  
- Purpose  
- Decision-making process  
- Meeting schedule  
- How funds will be handled  

> **Tip:** This agreement will be required when applying for an EIN and opening a bank account. You can find sample UNA Agreements by searching online or by visiting our FAQ and blog at [unaguide.com](https://unaguide.com).

---

### 4. Apply for an EIN (Federal Tax ID)
An EIN allows you to open a bank account and manage funds collectively.  

> **Action:** Apply online at the [IRS EIN website](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online). It's free and approval is immediate.

---

### 5. Check State Requirements
Some states require UNA registration; others do not. Filing usually involves a short form and small fee ($25–$100).  

> **Action:** Visit your Secretary of State's website and search for *"Unincorporated Association"* or *"Nonprofit filings."*

---

### 6. Open a Bank Account
A dedicated UNA bank account protects members and ensures transparency.  

> **Tip:** Bring your EIN and UNA Agreement. Compare **local credit unions** (community focus) and **online banks** (convenience, lower fees).

---

### 7. Maintain Written Records
Good records strengthen leadership and accountability. Keep track of:  
- Member roster and contact information  
- Meeting notes and decisions  
- Financial activity and bank statements  
- UNA Agreement updates and amendments  

> **Tip:** Create folders for "Members," "Meetings," and "Finances." Use tools like Google Drive for document storage, Airtable for member management, Wave for bookkeeping, or Stripe for payment processing.
